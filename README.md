# PSCopyID
A powershell version of ssh-copy-id for Windows SSH

### PS1 Branch (working)
This version of the script is written as a .ps1 file. This has limitations and will be updated to C# as soon as possible. This also need to be converted to be a module. This script works  in it's current state, but is only a basic skeleton.
