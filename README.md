# PSCopyID
A powershell version of ssh-copy-id for Windows SSH

### PS1 Branch (working)
This version of the script is written as a .ps1 file. This may be upgraded to C# soon in the cs branch, but this will work for now

## TODO
* Recreate all functions in openssh/contrib/ssh-copy-id
* add os detection to propely handle remote windows hosts
